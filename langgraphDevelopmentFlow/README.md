# What is it I want to achieve

Each graph is composed on several nodes. Each node is a python function. Each of these nodes need to be tested and developed individually before they can be deployed in a graph. This is what I want to achieve. 

- [DONE] Develop states separately
    states.ipynb
- [DONE] Build tavilySearch node separately in separate jupyter notebook.
    tavilyTesting.ipynb
- [DONE] build summerizer node separately in a separate jupyter notebook.
    summarizer.ipynb
- [DONE] Then we want to combine all these **without** copy pasting the codes.
    combined.ipynb
